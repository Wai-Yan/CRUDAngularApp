# Angular Assignment

Here is the repo for the completed Angular assignment. Written in AngularJS version 1.5.

I would normally put the API key in a .env file, and would do so in a professional setting. So that you could survey my app with an already-existant set of data, I left it in.

The following tutorial was written for Mac OS, requires NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Getting Started (Mac)

You'll need to npm install:

```
npm install
```

Then to start the server:

```
node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server -c-1
```

Then go to localhost:8080
From here you can access the app as intended.

### Getting Started (CentOS/RHEL)

You'll need to npm install:

```
npm install
```

Then to start the server:

```
node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server -c-1
```

Then go to localhost:8080
From here you can access the app as intended.
