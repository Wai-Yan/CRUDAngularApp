# Angular Assignment

Here is the repo for the completed Angular assignment. Written in AngularJS version 1.5.

I would normally put the API key in a .env file, and would do so in a professional setting. So that you could survey my app with an already-existant set of data, I left it in.

### Getting Started

You'll need to install a server package:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Then to start the server:

```
http-server -c-1
```

Then go to localhost:8080 { Check actual clickable link }
From here you can access the app as intended.
